               RECOMMENDATION:
               - For nested forwards, if total combinations are low (<5), you may choose "all_combinations".

        CONVERSATION SCENARIO: {profile["name"]}
        USER ROLE: {profile["role"]}
        {variables_info}{language_info}

        PARAMETERS TO DETERMINE:

        {number_section}

        2. MAX_COST:
           - Set a budget limit for all conversations combined, in dollars.
           - For specific number conversations: typically 0.5-1.0 dollars.
           - For "all_combinations": use higher limits (1.5-3.0) since there will be more conversations.
           - For "sample(X)": scale based on X value - higher X needs higher budget.
           - IMPORTANT: Consider the complexity of the conversation and goals when setting this limit.

        3. GOAL_STYLE:
           Choose ONE option that best fits this conversation scenario:
           - "steps": Fixed number of conversation turns between 5-12, use for simple conversations with predictable flow.
           - "all_answered": Ends when all user goals are addressed (can include "limit" parameters so the conversation length is still capped), use when testing the goals are very different from one another so it will be difficult to reach them or when testing something that looks like a core feature. Set a limit of 10 to 20 steps.
           - "random_steps": Random number of turns up to a maximum value, use when testing chatbot resilience with varied interaction lengths.

           EXAMPLE FORMAT:
           - For steps: {{"steps": 7}}
           - For all_answered: {{"all_answered": {{"limit": 10}}}}
           - For random_steps: {{"random_steps": 12}}

        4. INTERACTION_STYLE:
           Choose 1-2 appropriate styles based on the user role and scenario:
           - "long phrases": user uses very long phrases to write any query
           - "change your mind": user changes their mind during conversation (good for ordering/booking)
           - "change language": user switches languages mid-conversation (requires list of languages)
           - "make spelling mistakes": user makes typos and spelling mistakes
           - "single question": user asks only one query per interaction
           - "all questions": user asks everything from goals in one interaction
           - "random": applies random styles from a specified list
           - If no style is specified, "default" is used (natural conversation style)

           RECOMMENDATION:
           - Select styles that match your user's likely behavior
           - Use "change your mind" for scenarios where selections are made
           - Use "single question" for complex conversations, "all questions" for simpler ones
           - Use "random" with a list when you want varied interaction styles
           - Use "change language" when the chatbot supports multiple languages {supported_languages_text}

           EXAMPLES:
           - Single style: "make spelling mistakes"
           - Multiple styles: ["long phrases", "change your mind"]
           - Random with language change:
             random:
               - make spelling mistakes
               - all questions
               - long phrases
               - change language:
