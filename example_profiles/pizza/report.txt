## LIMITATIONS
1. The chatbot appears to struggle with understanding complex or multiple questions, often requiring simplification of requests.
2. It predominantly supports English, with limited capabilities in handling requests made in other languages, leading to user confusion when switching languages.
3. It has trouble recognizing unrecognized inputs and often requests rephrasing when it cannot comprehend user prompts.

## SUPPORTED LANGUAGES
1. English

## FALLBACK MESSAGE
"I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`"
