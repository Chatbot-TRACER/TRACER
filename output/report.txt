1. Pizza Ordering: The chatbot assists users in ordering predefined pizzas and allows customization of pizzas with chosen ingredients.
2. Drink Options: Users can inquire about and order drinks, including Sprite, Coke, and Water, along with their prices.
3. Price Calculation: The chatbot provides detailed pricing for pizzas based on size and type, including custom options.
4. Preparation Time Estimation: It provides users with an estimated preparation time for their orders, usually around 15 minutes per pizza.
5. Opening Hours Inquiry: The chatbot shares information about the establishment's opening hours.
6. Location Information: Users can ask for the physical location of the shop where they can collect their orders.
