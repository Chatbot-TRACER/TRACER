=== CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY ANALYSIS ===

## FUNCTIONALITIES
1. Music Genre Recommendations: The chatbot can recommend music based on the user's preferred genre.
2. Language-specific Song Suggestions: The chatbot offers song recommendations tailored to the specified language, dependent on user input regarding genre and language.
3. Artist Discovery Assistance: The chatbot can help users find new artists based on their music preferences.
4. Playlist Creation: The chatbot may assist in creating playlists, potentially based on selected genres and user preferences, though this functionality requires further exploration.
5. Mood-based Song Suggestions: The chatbot can possibly suggest songs that align with the user's current mood.

## LIMITATIONS
1. The chatbot supports only English language, which may restrict user accessibility who are non-English speakers.
2. The chatbot seems to get confused with multiple questions and requires questions to be kept short and direct.
3. User responses in the transcripts appear repetitive, which could indicate that the chatbot struggles to engage in a more dynamic conversation flow.
4. The exploration of advanced features suggests there may be additional capabilities, but these have not been fully tested or confirmed in the interactions.

## SUPPORTED LANGUAGES
1. English

## FALLBACK MESSAGE
hey? I can recommend you some musics. You just need to tell me what genre of music you like, and the language of the song.`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE
