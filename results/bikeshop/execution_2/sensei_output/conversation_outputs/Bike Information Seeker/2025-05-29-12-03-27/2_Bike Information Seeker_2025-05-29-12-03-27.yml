- service_information: It's generally recommended to lubricate your bike chain every
    100 to 200 miles, or more frequently if you ride in wet or muddy conditions. Regular
    lubrication helps keep the chain running smoothly and extends its lifespan. It's
    generally recommended to get a bike tune-up once a year or every 1,000 miles,
    whichever comes first. Regular tune-ups help keep your bike in optimal condition
    and ensure safe riding. A bike tune-up typically includes adjusting the brakes
    and gears, lubricating the chain, checking tire pressure, inspecting the frame
    and components for wear, and making any necessary repairs to ensure your bike
    is in optimal condition.
