    It's generally recommended to lubricate your bike chain every 100 to 200 miles,
    or more frequently if you ride in wet or muddy conditions. I recommend using a
    bike-specific chain lubricant, which can be either wet or dry depending on your
    riding conditions. Wet lubricants are good for wet and muddy conditions, while
    dry lubricants are better for dry, dusty environments. It's generally recommended
    to get a bike tune-up once a year or every 1,000 miles, whichever comes first.
    A bike tune-up typically includes adjustments to the brakes and gears, lubrication
    of moving parts, tire inspection and inflation, and a general safety check.
