- User: What distinguishes all-season tires from all-terrain tires?
- Assistant: All-season tires are designed for a variety of weather conditions, providing
    a balanced performance in dry, wet, and light winter conditions. They are ideal
    for everyday driving and offer good traction and durability. All-terrain tires,
    on the other hand, are built for off-road conditions and rough terrains. They
    have a more aggressive tread pattern for better grip on dirt, mud, and gravel,
    making them suitable for outdoor adventures and off-road driving.
