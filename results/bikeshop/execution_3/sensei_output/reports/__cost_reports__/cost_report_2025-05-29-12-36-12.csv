Assistant: All-season tires are designed for a variety of weather conditions, providing a balanced performance in dry, wet, and light winter conditions. They are ideal for everyday driving and offer good traction and durability. All-terrain tires, on the other hand, are built for off-road conditions and rough terrains. They have a more aggressive tread pattern for better grip on dirt, mud, and gravel, making them suitable for outdoor adventures and off-road driving.

Assistant: All-season tires are designed for a variety of weather conditions, providing a balanced performance in dry, wet, and light winter conditions. They are ideal for everyday driving and offer good traction and durability. All-terrain tires, on the other hand, are built for off-road conditions and rough terrains. They have a more aggressive tread pattern for better grip on dirt, mud, and gravel, making them suitable for outdoor adventures and off-road driving.
