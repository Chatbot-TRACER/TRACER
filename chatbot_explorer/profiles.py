        For each variable I listed below, provide a definition following these guidelines:

        1. Choose the most appropriate FUNCTION from:
           - default(): assigns all data in the list to the variable
           - random(): picks one random sample from the list
           - random(X): picks X random samples from the list
           - random(rand): picks a random number of random samples
           - another(): picks different samples without repetition
           - another(X): picks X different samples without repetition
           - forward(): iterates through each sample one by one
           - forward(other_var): iterates and nests with other_var

        2. Choose the most appropriate TYPE from:
           - string: for text values
           - int: for whole numbers
           - float: for decimal numbers

        3. IMPORTANT: Provide DATA in the correct format:
           - For string variables: use a list of realistic string values, the length of the list should be at least 3 items and at most 10 items, use the amount of data that makes sense for the variable
           - For int variables: ALWAYS use the min/max/step format like this:
             min: 1
             max: 10
             step: 1
           - For float variables: ALWAYS use the min/max/step format OR linspace like this:
             min: 1.0
             max: 5.0
             step: 0.5
             OR
             min: 1.0
             max: 5.0
             linspace: 5

        VARIABLES TO DEFINE:
        {", ".join(sorted(all_variables))}

      - Asking for office hours,
      - Opening a service ticket,
      - Requesting information about specific services.

        ABOUT VARIABLES:
        - Only use {{variable}} where the user might provide different values each time (e.g. {{date}}, {{amount}}, {{phone_number}}, {{dog_breed}})
        - These are purely placeholders for possible user input. For example, {{phone_number}} does not mean we must always request a phone number; it‚Äôs just a potential input that could vary.
        - Do NOT put fixed names like "Centro de Atenci√≥n a Usuarios" or "CAU" inside {{ }} (they are not interchangeable).
        - Variables must be legitimate parameters the user could change (e.g., different dates, amounts, or IDs).

        EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
        1. NEVER create goals about asking for chatbot limitations or capabilities
        2. NEVER create goals about testing the chatbot's understanding or knowledge
        3. NEVER include meta-goals like "find out what the chatbot can do"
        4. Goals MUST be about actual tasks a real user would want to accomplish
        5. Focus on practical, realistic user tasks ONLY

        Create 2-4 goals that focus strictly on what the user intends to achieve with the chatbot.
        Avoid vague or indirect objectives like "consultar las limitaciones del chatbot" or "solicitar ejemplos sobre el CAU."

        Examples of good goal sets:

        Example 1 (Food ordering):
        - "Order a {{size}} pizza with {{toppings}}"
        - "Add {{quantity}} {{drink}} to my order"
        - "Ask about delivery time"
        - "Get my order total and confirmation number"

        Example 2 (Municipal services):
        - "Ask about property tax"
        - "Find out how to pay it"

        Example 3 (City registration):
        - "Ask how to register as a resident"
        - "Find out what documents are needed"
        - "Ask if registration can be done online"

        FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:

        GOALS:
        - "first user-centric goal with {{variable}} if needed"
        - "second related goal"
        - "third goal that follows naturally"

        DO NOT include any definitions for variables - just use {{varname}} placeholders.
