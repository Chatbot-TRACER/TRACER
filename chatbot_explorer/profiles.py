        Examples of good goal sets:

        Example 1 (Food ordering):
        - "Order a {{size}} pizza with {{toppings}}"
        - "Add {{quantity}} {{drink}} to my order"
        - "Ask about delivery time"

        Example 2 (Municipal services):

        - "Find out how to pay it"

        Example 3 (City registration):
